# Returns Logistics & Revenue Leakage Analysis

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project was to identify why net profits were declining despite stable sales. I built a data pipeline to analyze returns and hidden shipping costs.

##  Tools Used
* **SQL (MySQL):** Data modeling, cleaning, and joining sales/returns tables.
* **Python (Pandas, Seaborn):** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and financial loss visualization.
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboarding for business stakeholders.

##  Key Insights
* **The "NULL" Factor:** A large portion of returns had no recorded reason, suggesting a gap in data collection at the warehouse.
* **Category Loss:** The 'Beauty' category has the highest return rate (15.5%), significantly eating into margins.
* **Profitability:** Identified that shipping costs for returned items are the primary "hidden" cost.
